# Implementing some algorithms

## Purpose

- Get comfy enough with these algorithms to not fail the final
- Get comfy turning these ideas into code

## What I've Done

- Non-deterministic rank selection
- Red Black tree insertion 
- Longest common subsequence
- Interval tree
- Breadth first search - shortest path in unweighted graph
- Dijkstra shortest path
- Bellman Ford shortest path
- Minimum Spanning Tree with Kruskal's algorithm
- DFS / Topological DAG sort
- Scheduling with priorities and dependencies

## Coming Up (hopefully)

- Rod cutting
- Partition graph by connected components
- Prim's algorithm
- DAG shortest path
