# Implementing some algorithms

## Purpose

- Get comfy enough with these algorithms to not fail the final
- Get comfy turning these ideas into code

## What I've Done

- Non-deterministic rank selection
- Red Black tree insertion 
- Longest common subsequence

## Coming Up (hopefully)

- Rod cutting
- BFS and DFS
- Topological DAG sort
- Partition graph by connected components
- Minimum spanning tree with Kruskal and Prim
- Bellman Ford' shortest path
- Dijkstra' shortest path
- DAG shortest path
